        <p class="text-lg mt-6">As the pastor of a local church, my kids have had the unique opportunity to make friends with missionaries coming through our church every year who go on to live in places like South Africa, the Philipines and Germany.  Since they could talk, they have been asking to go visit these friends and it's always been my goal to take them on multiple trips.  But, it's expensive.</p>
        <p class="text-lg mt-6">So I started Mission Trip BBQ as a way to pay for our trips to see our missionary friends and help in their mission works.  I cook the meat and the girls help me divide and deliver it.</p>
        
        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl mt-12">Our First Trip: South Africa</h2>
         <img src="/camp_rhino.jpg" alt="South Africa" class="w-full max-w-lg h-auto mx-auto my-6">
        <p class="text-lg mt-6">Our first trip will be in March 2024 where we hope to help several missionary friends ministring in the townships in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.  I will be teaching and preaching in multiple churches and helping in their school and campground.  We need to raise about $7,000 for this trip.</p>
